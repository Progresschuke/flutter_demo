# Multi_Quiz_app


The application itself is a Quiz App, designed to challenge users' cognitive abilities. Upon completion, users are presented with their quiz results.

The navigation within the app is seamless, effortlessly guiding users from one question to the next. Additionally, I've incorporated a dynamic theming feature, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes based on their preferences.
